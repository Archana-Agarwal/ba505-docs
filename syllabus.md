### Course Description

This course introduces Python as a language and tool for collecting, preprocessing, and visualizing data for business analytics. 
Long a favorite language among data scientists and business analysts, Python is an essential skill with applications in business modeling, 
optimization, statistical analysis, deep learning, and big data analytics. Starting with a review of the fundamental programming concepts, 
the course builds mastery of Python language, libraries, and tools through short lectures and online tutorials. 
The course concludes with a final project designed to demonstrate mastery of the subject.

## Course Materials
### Required Textbooks
There are two required textbooks for this course. You will have to get ahold of them before the second class:
+ __Python for Everybody: Exploring Data in Python 3__ (PY4E), by Charles R. Severance, available
[here](https://www.py4e.com/book.php). Both the PDF and HTML versions are __free__.
+ __Pandas: Powerful Python Data Analysis Toolkit__ (PPDAT), by Wes McKinney & PyData Development Team, available 
[here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/pandas.pdf). The PDF version is __free__.

### Other Materials
Other materials used in this course include, but not limit to: lecture slides, Jupyter notebooks, data files - 
these will be distributed via Github.

### Technical Requirements
Jupyter notebooks/Jupyterhub/JupyterLab are used throughout this course. You can use the university's [BA Lab](https://ba-lab.fairfield.edu/hub/login) or your own distribution. 

__Note:__ It is __YOUR OWN__ responsibility to make sure you have access to at least one of the above computing environments.

GitHub will be used to disseminate class materials - make sure you have a __working GitHub Account__.

## Learning Objectives

### Theory
+ To introduce fundamentals of logical reasoning as used in contemporary programming languages
+ To survey basic and advanced data structures needed to organize, store, and integrate data
+ To master syntax, control structures, data types, etc. in the Python programming language
+ To introduce Python (in particular, **Pandas**) as a tool for data science

### Practice
+ To write Python scripts of intermediate length and complexity
+ To design and use custom data structures using built-in and third-party data types
+ To introduce and use popular Pandas library for storing and preparing data for analytics
+ To master a professional-level data science software toolkit with `Anaconda`, `Jupyter`, `GitHub`, etc.

## Grading Policies

This class is graded based on a point system (with a total of __1,000__ points), with multiple deliverables. The deliverables and associated points are shown below. I reserve the right to change following policies when deemed needed.


| Deliverables | Point Value |
:--- | :---
| In-class Labs | 10 x 12 = __120__ points |
| Coding Assignments | 18 x 10 = __180__ points |
| Final Project Proposal | __100__ points |
| Final Project Deliverable | __500__ points |
| Participation and Professionalism | __100__ points |
| __Total__ | __1,000__ points|

### Grading Scale

*Percentages and letter grades are provided for your convenience, as this class (noted above) is based on a point system.*

| Total Points | Percentage | Letter Grade |
:--- | :--- | :--- 
| 930 - 1,000 | 93 - 100 | A |
| 900 - 929 | 90 - 92.9 | A- |
| 870 - 899 | 87 - 89.9 | B+ |
| 830 - 869 | 83 - 86.9 | B |

## Course Deliverables
### In-class Labs
In some of the classes, you are required to complete hands-on mini labs in class, in which you will need to apply skills covered in 
respective classes. You will need to __submit__ the __completed__ notebook before the __following class__.

### Coding Assignments
There are two individual assignments that focus on the __practice__ parts of the learning objectives. The assignments are worth 9% each 
and are based on the following business applications.
+ __HealthStats Project__: 
+ __Course Catelog Porject__: 

### Final Project
Students will self-select into teams of about 2-3 students and will work in their
own time outside of class to complete a Python “code portfolio” that they can show future employers
to demonstrate their proficiency. Each portfolio should consist of one or more Jupyter notebooks
posted on __Github__, and should focus on analyzing a particular set of data to uncover business insights.
The analysis will not only be graded based on the use of Python, but also on the _logic_, _presentation_,
_rigor_, and _business relevance_. Students are encouraged to find their own datasets rather than using
those from in-class activities. There are __two__ deliverables for the final project:
